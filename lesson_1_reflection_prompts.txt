    You can go back and see how you previously did something.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pro is intelligently chosen versions. The con is you might forget to make a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is used for coding, which often involves related files.
    Google Docs is for text files, which are usually independent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to see previous versions with change notes
    Use git diff to compare versions and track changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You know you can go back if something breaks

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Doing the things?
